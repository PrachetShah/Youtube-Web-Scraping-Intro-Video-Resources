from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Step 1: Make a Request to the Website
url = 'https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/'  # Replace with the URL of the website you want to scrape
response = requests.get()

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print(f"Successfully connected to {url}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to connect to {url}. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    exit()
